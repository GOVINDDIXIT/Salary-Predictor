# Salary Predictor

*A Salary predictor machine learning model based on Linear Regression, can be used to predict the salaries of the employees based on their experiences.*

### DataSet
Dataset consists of 30 entries of employess with the salaries based upon their experiences in years

- *Training Set = 80% of total dataset = 24 entries*

- *Test Set = 20% of total dataset = 6 entries*

Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. Different regression models differ based on â€“ the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables, they are considering and the number of independent variables being used.
